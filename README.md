    <h2>Hï§†ðr¥ ð£ ¢rêêþ¥þå§†å</h2>
             <ul>With the spread of global computer networks in the 1990s, a new genre of modern folklore emerged, prefigured by urban legends. However, unlike urban legends, which are passed down by word of mouth with changes made by each new narrator, the "networked" stories were copied unchanged thanks to the written form. Their other distinguishing feature was the rich use of so called "fear markers" - phrases that indicate the fear experienced by the characters. One of the first such stories to become widely known was Ted's Cave, written in the form of blog entries and posted online in 2001.</ul>

             <ul>In the early 2010s, variations secondary to the original kripipasts began to actively spread - additions, sequels, prequels, reworkings, etc. Against this background, a fandom associated with human and anthropomorphic characters of kripipasts appeared on the Internet. Thanks to him, a specific interpretation of the term "kripipasta" arose, meaning exactly such characters, and not the genre of Internet folklore that gave rise to them. A large amount of fan art, including fanfiction, has been created within its framework. The most popular characters were Jeff and Slenderman. However, this fandom has gained a bad reputation as a refuge for mentally unstable people and is considered "toxic" both in Western countries and in Russia.The negative attitude towards both fandom and the term "kripipasta" is also fueled by media publications in which kripipasta is mentioned along with "death groups" and the game "Blue Whale".</ul>
             <ul>Tick current screamers were also popular earlier than 2020. It is located below.</ul>
